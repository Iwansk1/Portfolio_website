            <p class="info_text">My name is Iwan Bijl I am 22 years old and live in the Netherlands. <br> 
            Currently I am working on becoming a front-end web developer. <br> before I even started with front-end development
            I was trying to become a 3D-artist, but after I finished that study I was not very fond of the idea of that being my fulltime job. <br> 
            So I decided to do another study this was CMD (Communication and Multimedia Desgin, I am still busy with this study) During this study I discovered front-end development and have been working on learning and improving this ever since. <br>
            Apart from my studies I am very passionate about cars and especially autocross(the european version). </p>

        <div class="info_game">
            <p class="info_text">During my time as a 3D-artist I was mostly working on hard surface modeling. <br> For the most part I  was busy making weapons, this was also influenced by the internship I did. <br> I did my internship at the ministry of defence at a military base in Amersfoort. <br>
            Ever since I started CMD the amount of time I spent working on 3D models has drasticlly decreased, but I am trying to pick it up again.</p>

            <img class="info_img" src="Images/Code_logo.jpg" alt="">
            <p class="info_text">At the start of my CMD study I did not know what to do, so I did a little bit of everything: Video editing, 2d animations, illustration and some UI/UX design. <br>
            The UI/UX design is what pulled me towards web design at first but then I tried out some coding and found this way more rewarding then making some pretty wireframes, so I started to shift my focus from UI/UX desgin to front-end development, and now I am here creating my own portfolio website.</p>
